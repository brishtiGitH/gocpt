    "Be comprehensive in documenting the patient encounter. Include a detailed history of present illness, an exhaustive examination, and a comprehensive medical decision-making process. Capture all relevant details, ensuring that your notes paint a complete picture of the patient's condition and your clinical assessment",

    "Assess Risk and ComplexityEvaluate and document the risk of complications and/or morbidity associated with the patient's condition. Be explicit about the factors contributing to the complexity of the case. The goCPT app considers risk assessment, and detailed documentation aids in accurate code generation",

    "Time-Based CodingUtilize time-based coding when appropriate. If a significant portion of the encounter is devoted to counseling or coordination of care, document the time spent. The goCPT app recognizes time as a crucial factor in certain code selections, contributing to accurate billing",

    "Provide specific details about each medical issue. Describe the nature, severity, and progression of symptoms. Specificity enhances the accuracy of code generation by ensuring that the app captures the complexity of the patient's conditions and the level of decision-making required",

    "Include Relevant DataEnsure that your note incorporates all relevant data, including diagnostic test results, imaging studies, and laboratory findings. The goCPT app considers the complexity of data analysis, so including these details enhances the accuracy of the generated codes",

    "Ensure that your note incorporates all relevant data, including ordering or reviewing diagnostic test results, imaging studies, and laboratory findings. The goCPT app considers the complexity of data analysis, so including these details enhances the accuracy of the generated codes",

    "Keep the goCPT app updated to ensure you benefit from the latest enhancements and refinements. Regular updates enhance the app's capabilities, providing you with increasingly accurate code suggestions",

    "Stay abreast of changes in coding guidelines and standards. Familiarize yourself with any updates to CPT codes or relevant regulations. A well-informed approach ensures that your documentation aligns with current coding requirements"
