    "At goCPT, our mission is simple yet profound - to empower mental health professionals and remove the barriers that hinder them from providing quality care and pursuing their dreams of private practice. We believe that every individual should have access to exceptional mental health care, and that starts with simplifying the coding and billing process.",

    "We envision a future where mental health care is more accessible, where providers can focus on what they do best - helping individuals on their path to wellness. By harnessing the power of technology, we aim to streamline the complexities of CPT coding, enabling providers to dedicate more time to patient care and less to administrative burdens."
